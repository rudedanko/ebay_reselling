			<p id="lol"> Signs Ebay Selling is For You <p>
				<p id="lo"> 1. You enjoy the thrill of the hunt - if you like scouring thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces for hidden gems, eBay reselling could be a good fit for you.</p>
				<p id="lo"> 2. You have knowledge about a particular niche - if you have expertise in a certain area, such as vintage clothing or collectibles, you can use that knowledge to source and sell items on eBay. </p>

			<p id="lol"> Signs that eBay reselling might not be for you </p>
			<p id="lo">1. You don't enjoy dealing with customers - if you're not comfortable communicating with buyers, handling customer complaints, and managing returns, eBay reselling may not be a good fit for you.</p>
			<p id="lo">2. You're not willing to put in the time and effort - successful eBay reselling requires a lot of time and effort, from sourcing products to listing and managing orders. If you're not willing to dedicate the time, eBay reselling may not be the right choice for you.</p>
